## How to Use PS Move Controllers on PC with PS Move API
 
If you want to use your PS Move controllers on PC for games or applications that support motion tracking, you will need a different solution than the one mentioned above. The PS Move API is an open source library that allows you to access the Sony Move Motion Controller via Bluetooth and USB directly from your PC without the need for a PlayStation 3.[^1^] You will also need a PlayStation Eye camera (on Linux, Windows and macOS), an iSight camera (on macOS) or any other suitable camera source to track the controllers in 3D space.
 
Here are some steps to install and use the PS Move API on your PC.

1. Download and install the PS Move API from [this link](https://thp.io/2010/psmove/). You will find binaries for Windows, Linux and macOS, as well as source code and documentation.[^1^]
2. Pair your PS Move controllers with your PC via Bluetooth as described in the previous section.
3. Connect your camera to your PC and make sure it is recognized by your system.
4. Run the psmove pair utility from the PS Move API folder to pair your controllers with your camera. You will see a list of connected controllers and cameras, and you will be asked to press the trigger button on each controller to pair it with the camera.
5. Run the psmove test utility from the PS Move API folder to test your controllers and camera. You will see a window with a video feed from your camera and a 3D model of each controller. You can move and rotate your controllers and see how they are tracked by the camera. You can also press buttons on your controllers and see how they are detected by the API.
6. You can now use your PS Move controllers on PC with any game or application that supports the PS Move API. You can find some examples and tutorials on [this page](https://github.com/thp/psmoveapi).[^1^]

Note: The PS Move API is a low-level library that requires some programming skills to use. It is not a plug-and-play solution for using your PS Move controllers on PC. If you are looking for a more user-friendly way to use your PS Move controllers on PC, you might want to check out some other projects that use the PS Move API, such as [PSMoveService](https://github.com/cboulay/PSMoveService) or [PSMoveSteamVRBridge](https://github.com/HipsterSloth/PSMoveSteamVRBridge).
