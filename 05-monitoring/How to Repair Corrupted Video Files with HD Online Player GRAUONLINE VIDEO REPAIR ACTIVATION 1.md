HD Online Player (GRAUONLINE VIDEO REPAIR ACTIVATION 1) is a software developed by Grau GmbH Hardware & Software Solutions, a company that specializes in data recovery and video processing. The software can repair and fix video files that use one of the following codec formats: avc1 (H264/AVC), hevc (H265), mp4v (H264/ISO), MPG2 / xdvc / xd5d / xd5e (MPEG-2 / XDCAM), jpg (Motion JPEG), icod (Apple Intermediate Codec), dvc / dvpp / dvhp (DVCPRO / DVCPRO HD), apch / apcn / apcs / apco / ap4h (ProRes 4444/422/LT/HQ/Proxy). The software supports video files that are based on QuickTime container format, such as .mov, .mp4, m4v, or .3gp.
 
The software works by using a non-broken sample movie of your camera to find missing movie meta-data and parameters. It then reconstructs the raw video and audio stream data from the corrupted file and creates a new playable video file. The software does not depend on a valid/correct container format, so it can repair videos that were not finalized by the camera or have a damaged header.
