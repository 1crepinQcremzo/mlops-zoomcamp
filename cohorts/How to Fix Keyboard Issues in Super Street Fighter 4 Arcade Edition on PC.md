## Step 1: Update Your Keyboard Drivers
 
One of the possible causes of keyboard issues in Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition on PC is outdated or corrupted keyboard drivers. Drivers are software that allow your hardware devices to communicate with your operating system. If your keyboard drivers are not up to date or compatible with your PC, they might cause conflicts or errors that affect your gaming experience.
 
To update your keyboard drivers, you can use Microsoft's Device Manager tool. Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Press the Windows key + X on your keyboard and select Device Manager from the menu.
2. Expand the Keyboards category and right-click on your keyboard device.
3. Select Update driver from the context menu.
4. Choose Search automatically for updated driver software and follow the on-screen instructions.
5. Restart your PC after the update is complete.

If Windows does not find any updates for your keyboard drivers, you can also try downloading them manually from the manufacturer's website. Make sure you choose the correct model and version of your keyboard and follow the installation instructions carefully.
 
## Step 2: Change Your Keyboard Settings
 
Another possible cause of keyboard issues in Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition on PC is incorrect or incompatible keyboard settings. For example, if you have a different keyboard layout than the default one, you might have problems with some keys not matching the game's controls. Or if you have enabled some accessibility features such as Sticky Keys or Filter Keys, they might interfere with your gaming performance.
 
To change your keyboard settings, you can use Microsoft's Settings app. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Press the Windows key + I on your keyboard and select Devices from the Settings app.
2. Select Keyboard from the left pane and check if the Keyboard layout matches your physical keyboard. If not, click on Add a keyboard and choose the correct one from the list.
3. Scroll down to Related settings and click on Additional keyboard settings under More keyboard settings.
4. Select Change how your keyboard works from the Control Panel window that opens.
5. Uncheck any boxes that might affect your gaming performance, such as Turn on Sticky Keys, Turn on Toggle Keys, Turn on Filter Keys, etc.
6. Click on Apply and OK to save your changes.

## Step 3: Configure Your Game Settings
 
The final step to fix keyboard issues in Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition on PC is to configure your game settings. Sometimes, the game might not recognize or support your keyboard device or layout properly, which can cause problems with some keys or functions. To fix this, you can adjust some options in the game's menu or configuration file.
 
To configure your game settings, you can follow these steps:

1. Launch Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition on your PC and go to Options from the main menu.
2. Select Keyboard Settings and check if the key bindings match your preferences. If not, you can change them by clicking on the corresponding buttons and pressing the desired keys on your keyboard.
3. Save your changes and exit the game.
4. Navigate to the folder where you installed the game (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Super Street Fighter IV - Arcade Edition) and locate the config.ini file.
5. Right-click on the config.ini file and select Open with Notepad or any other text editor.
6. Find the line that says KeyboardType=0 and change it to KeyboardType=1. This will enable DirectInput mode for your keyboard, which might improve its compatibility with the game. 0f148eb4a0
